This is the small research conducted by Sergei Korotkikh and Vadim Maletskii. The repository contains the following folders:

- Data_preproc: csv files with the prepared data
- Figures: the plot and the linear regression model that demonstrate the relationship between the variables
- Scripts: the code scripts used during the research

For our research we used the ESS10 dataset. We supposed that the more people trust the police, the safer they feel alone outside at night. Our hypothesis proved to be true.
